/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces role-based access control (RBAC).
 * It distinguishes between general authenticated users and 'admins'. Admins
 * have full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) permissions across the
 * database, while general authenticated users have read-only access. This
 * ensures that sensitive financial data can only be modified by authorized
 * personnel.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /students/{studentId}: Contains student ledger information.
 * - /transactions/{transactionId}: A log of all financial transactions.
 * - /summary/{summaryId}: A singleton document for global financial summaries.
 * - /roles_admin/{userId}: A collection where the existence of a document
 *   indicates that the user is an admin.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Admin-Only Writes: All write operations (create, update, delete) are
 *   restricted to users with the 'admin' role for sensitive collections.
 * - Authenticated Access: All authenticated users are granted read and write access 
 *   to core operational data like students and transactions.
 * - Admin Role Management: Only existing admins can grant or revoke admin
 *   privileges by creating or deleting documents in the `roles_admin` collection.
